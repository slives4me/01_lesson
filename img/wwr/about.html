     <h2>History</h2>
     <p> "Founded in 2024, Rocky Mountain White Water Rafting has been providing thrilling whitewater rafting experiences for
      adventurers of all skill levels. Our founder, Steven Robert Lagaisse was passionate about outdoor
      recreation and
      saw an opportunity to share his love of rafting with others. With just a few rafts and a small team of
      guides, Billy began leading trips on some of the most scenic and challenging rivers in the area.
